# 🌸 Symbolism & Lore: The Soul of Celoris

**Celoris Desktop** is more than just a user interface; it is a love letter to the digital divas who inspire us and a tribute to the concept of the "Stage." This document outlines the symbolic meanings woven into the code, design, and naming conventions of the project.

## 🌌 Etymology: The Name "Celoris"

The name **Celoris** is a portmanteau derived from three Latin and stellar concepts:

1.  **Celer (Speed/Swift):** representing the high-performance, low-latency nature of the desktop environment.
2.  **Caelum (The Sky/Heavens):** symbolizing the boundless potential of the operating system.
3.  **Polaris (The North Star):** representing the desktop as the guiding light for the user.

It signifies a **"Swift Star in the Heavens,"** guiding the **Stargazer** (the root user) through the digital cosmos.

## 🎤 The Muses: Tributes & Dedications

The spirit of Celoris is shaped by two primary influences from the 2D dimension.

### 1. The Eternal Diva: Hatsune Miku (初音ミク)
*   **Symbolism:** **The Future & Connection.**
*   **Representation:** 
    *   The core color of the system, **Cyan**, is a direct homage to Miku's iconic hair color.
    *   The file system, **Cyan FileSystem (CYAN)**, represents the foundation of the world, just as Miku's voice is the foundation of her songs.
    *   The concept of **"Resonance Link"** (device continuity) is inspired by the idea that her music connects people across the world.

### 2. The Blooming Elite: Hanamai Saki (花海咲季)
*   **Symbolism:** **Perfection, Athletics & "Hanami" (v1.0).**
*   **Representation:**
    *   The **v1.0 Codename "Hanami"** is dedicated to Saki from *THE IDOLM@STER Gakuen*.
    *   Just as Saki is an elite "Former Athlete" idol who pushes her body to the limit for the perfect performance, Celoris v1.0 is engineered for **uncompromising performance**. 
    *   The **"Hikari Kernel"** scheduler (Overdrive Mode) mirrors Saki's intense training regimen—giving everything to the "Stage" (foreground app) even at the cost of exhausting resources.

## 🎭 The Design Metaphor: "The World is a Stage"

Celoris rejects the traditional desktop metaphors of "Office" or "Workbench." Instead, it treats the computer as a **Theater**, and the software as a **Performance**.

### The Stage (Desktop Area)
*   **Meaning:** The center of attention. The place where the magic happens.
*   **Function:** Unlike a cluttered desk, the Stage is meant to be clean, highlighting only the active performers (Windows).

### The Backstage (Dock / Taskbar)
*   **Meaning:** The preparation area.
*   **Function:** Apps sitting here are not "closed"; they are "waiting in the wings," ready to step onto the stage at a moment's notice.

### The Curtain (App Launcher)
*   **Meaning:** The reveal.
*   **Function:** Opening the launcher is like drawing back the curtain to reveal the full cast of characters (Applications) available to the producer.

### The Spotlight (Window Manager)
*   **Meaning:** Focus and Attention.
*   **Function:** The active window is "under the spotlight." In future versions, this may be visually represented by subtle lighting effects, dimming the background to ensure the user's focus is on the star of the show.

## 👤 The User Identity: "Stargazer"

In standard Linux systems, the administrator is `root`—a functional, tree-based term. In Cyanite/Celoris, the administrator is the **Stargazer**.

*   **The Meaning:** A Stargazer is one who looks up at the infinite possibilities of the universe (the OS) but also holds the knowledge to map, name, and understand the stars (Processes).
*   **The Philosophy:** The system is vast and complex, but the Stargazer has the vision to control it. It implies a sense of wonder rather than just utility.

## 🎨 Color Philosophy

*   **Cyanite Teal (`#39C5BB`):** The primary brand color. Represents logic, future, and Miku.
*   **Hanami Pink (`#FF4081`):** The accent color for v1.0. Represents passion, energy, and Saki.
*   **Void Black (`#121212`):** The background. Represents the infinite space of the universe where the stars reside.
